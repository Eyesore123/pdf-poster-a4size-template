I made a template for a marketing leaflet (A4 sized pdf). You can place your phone number on the bottom.  

Code uses html2pdf from eKoopmans, you can check the code here: -> <a href="https://github.com/eKoopmans/html2pdf.js.">Link!</a>

Making a pdf can be a bit finicky with this package, and you might have to adjust the margins and some of the values to make the template fit properly.
